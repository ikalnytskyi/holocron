    Processors may optionally be wrapped in another processors. This can be
    naturally achieved by passing a processor as input to another processor,
    and let the latter to invoke the former. Such syntaxes, however, is
    nested and hence complex. That's why Holocron provides a syntax sugar
    for wrapping processors:

        - name: commonmark
          args:
            ...
          when:
            ...

    where `when` is a wrapping processor and `commonmark` is wrapped
    processor. So this function naturally wraps `commonmark` and so we
    effectively resolve syntax sugar.
